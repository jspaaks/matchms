Vector representation and similarity measure for mass spectrometry data

The project setup is documented in `a separate document <project_setup.rst>`_.
Feel free to remove this document (and/or the link to this document) if you

Installation
============

Install matchms from PyPI with

.. code-block:: console

  pip install --user matchms

Glossary of terms
=================

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Term
     - Description
   * - adduct / addition product
     - During ionization in a mass spectrometer, the molecules of the injected compound break apart 
       into fragments. When fragments combine into a new compound, this is known as an addition 
       product, or adduct.  `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduct>`__
   * - GNPS
     - Knowledge base for sharing of mass spectrometry data (`link <https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp>`__).
   * - InChI / :code:`INCHI`
     - InChI is short for International Chemical Identifier. InChIs are useful
       in retrieving information associated with a certain molecule from a
       database.
   * - InChIKey / InChI key / :code:`INCHIKEY`
     - An indentifier for molecules. For example, the InChI key for carbon
       dioxide is :code:`InChIKey=CURLTUGMZLYLDI-UHFFFAOYSA-N` (yes, it
       includes the substring :code:`InChIKey=`).
   * - MGF File / Mascot Generic Format
     - A plan ASCII file format to store peak list data from a mass spectrometry experiment. Links: `matrixscience.com <http://www.matrixscience.com/help/data_file_help.html#GEN>`__, 
       `fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu <https://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/projects/lipidblast/mgf-files>`__.
   * - SMILES
     - A line notation for describing the structure of chemical species using
       short ASCII strings. For example, water is encoded as :code:`O[H]O`,
       carbon dioxide is encoded as :code:`O=C=O`, etc. SMILES-encoded species may be converted to InChIKey `using a resolver like this one <https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure>`__. The Wikipedia entry for SMILES is `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system>`__.
